# NewYearPuzzle

My attempt at squashing bugs and implementing functions for the NewYearPuzzle

## Running Locally

 - Clone the repository onto your local machine
 - Navigate to the cloned repository
 - Open up a Bash terminal window and run the program by typing ```python solve.py input5.txt```

## Additional Info

 - I couln't figure out how to implement a recursive solve.py function without using external libraries so I left my implementation written as pseudocode.
